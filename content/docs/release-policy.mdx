<DocsPageShell>

PyColors uses **two release layers** on purpose:

- **Packages** ship with **Semantic Versioning** (precise + technical truth).
- The **website** ships **weekly ecosystem releases** (clear narrative + trust).

This keeps momentum high while staying accurate for developers and customers.

---

## What should be public?

Yes — this policy should be **public**.

It improves trust (predictable shipping), reduces confusion (UI vs ecosystem), and makes contributions easier.

What stays private is the **internal runbook** (credentials, deployment secrets, and step-by-step CI ops).

---

## Two-level versioning

### 1) UI library — SemVer

`@pycolors/ui` follows Semantic Versioning.

<Tabs items={["Rules", "Examples"]}>
  <Tab value="Rules">
    ```txt
    MAJOR (x.0.0) → breaking changes
    MINOR (0.x.0) → new features (backward compatible)
    PATCH (0.0.x) → fixes & small improvements
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Examples">
    ```txt
    1.0.3 → patch: bug fixes, minor polish
    1.1.0 → minor: new components or capabilities
    2.0.0 → major: breaking API changes
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Source of truth**
- GitHub Releases for `pycolors-ui`
- `CHANGELOG.md` generated by Changesets

---

### 2) Ecosystem release — Weekly cadence

The website communicates a **weekly release** for the overall ecosystem:

- UI
- Starters (Free → Pro)
- Templates

<Tabs items={["Rule"]}>
  <Tab value="Rule">
    ```txt
    ECOSYSTEM_RELEASE is a narrative version (weekly).
    It must never block package releases.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Key idea**
- Packages ship **when ready**
- The website ships **every week** with honest progress

---

## The non-negotiables (ONE THING rules)

These are the rules that make everything else easier:

1. **Development happens only in the core monorepo** (`pycolors`).
2. **Product repos are distribution surfaces** (mirrors for releases + consumption).
3. **All public packages use Changesets** (no manual versioning).
4. **GitHub Releases = technical truth**.
5. **Website changelog = product narrative**.

---

## Changesets workflow (minimum bar)

<Tabs items={["Workflow"]}>
  <Tab value="Workflow">
    ```txt
    1) Make changes in monorepo
    2) Add a changeset (patch/minor/major)
    3) Merge to main
    4) CI bumps version + updates changelog
    5) CI publishes to npm + creates GitHub Release
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Where each changelog lives

| Surface | Purpose | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| `pycolors.io/changelog` | Weekly ecosystem updates | Product narrative |
| `pycolors-ui/CHANGELOG.md` | Package-level details | Changesets output |
| GitHub Releases (`pycolors-ui`) | Release artifacts | Tags + notes |
