<DocsPageShell>

Starter Free gives you a **credible SaaS surface out of the box**.

Not a blank repo.
Not a backend-heavy template.
A production-shaped UI with real screens, real states, and real navigation.

The goal: **run it in minutes, understand it in 15, extend it in 30.**

---

## You’ll learn

- What Starter Free actually includes
- What is intentionally mocked
- How to think about wiring it later
- The fastest path to shipping your first vertical slice

---

## What this starter already solves

Starter Free is opinionated on purpose.

It gives you a complete SaaS “surface area”:

### Auth UX

- `/login`
- `/register`
- `/forgot-password`
- Loading states
- Disabled + error-ready forms
- Password input with visibility toggle

Authentication is **not wired**, but the UX contract is complete.

---

### Application shell

- Dashboard layout
- Navigation
- PageShell abstraction
- Structured cards
- KPI surfaces

You are not designing layout from scratch.

---

### Core SaaS entity (Projects)

- Table list
- Loading state (`TableLoading`)
- Empty state (`TableEmpty`)
- Rename dialog
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Deep-link details page

This validates:
- CRUD surface
- Row actions
- Dialog patterns
- Routing consistency

---

### Admin / B2B surface

- Members list
- Invitations
- Roles (owner / member)
- Invite dialog
- Resend / cancel actions (mocked)

This makes the starter feel like a real B2B SaaS.

---

### Billing surface

- Current plan
- Renewal info
- Invoice table
- Stripe portal entrypoint (disabled)
- Payment method card

Everything is mocked — but structurally correct.

---

### Settings structure

- Tabs: Profile / Organization / Security / Danger zone
- Disabled form patterns
- Explicit destructive areas

This matters more than most people think.

---

## Mocked on purpose

<Alert>
  <AlertTitle>Frontend-only by design</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Starter Free ships with mock data and no backend. This lets you evaluate structure and UX first — then wire auth, data, and billing progressively.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

Nothing is connected to:
- Database
- Stripe
- Auth provider
- Email provider

That is intentional.

The goal is to:
1. Validate product structure
2. Validate UI states
3. Validate navigation
4. Avoid backend friction early

---

## What you can ship in 30 minutes

After installation, you can:

- Rename “Projects” to your domain entity
- Adjust dashboard KPIs
- Update empty state messaging
- Change brand tokens
- Add one new route

That’s already enough to:
- Show a client
- Pitch an MVP
- Validate UX
- Record a demo

---

## Mental model

Think of Starter Free as:

> **A UX contract, not an implementation.**

You keep:
- Pages
- Components
- States
- Navigation

You swap:
- Data source
- Auth provider
- Billing logic

No rewrites required.

---

## Common pitfalls

### 1. Treating it like a full SaaS backend

This starter does not include:
- Database schema
- API routes
- Stripe integration
- Session management

That comes later.

---

### 2. Rewriting everything too early

Don’t delete structure before understanding it.

Explore:
- Dashboard
- Projects flow
- Admin surface
- Billing surface

Then extend.

---

### 3. Mixing UI and business logic

Keep the separation:

- UI = screens + states
- Logic = wiring layer

The starter models that separation clearly.

---

## When Starter Free is enough

Starter Free is perfect if:

- You’re validating UX
- You’re pitching a product
- You’re building a frontend-first MVP
- You want structure before backend

If you need:

- Production auth wiring
- Stripe portal integration
- Multi-org logic
- Role-based access control
- Backend contracts

You’ll want PRO (see Upgrade later).

---

## Recommended first path

After cloning:

1. Open `/dashboard`
2. Open `/projects`
3. Rename a project
4. Delete a project
5. Open `/admin`
6. Open `/billing`

Understand the vertical slice.

Then wire your own logic progressively.

## Next steps

Continue to:

→ **Installation**

You’ll run the starter locally and explore the real screens.
