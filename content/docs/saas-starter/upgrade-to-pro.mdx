Starter Free helps you **validate and ship fast**.
PRO helps you **wire and scale safely**.

You can stay on Starter Free as long as you want.
Upgrade when the product becomes real.

## You’ll learn

- When upgrading makes sense
- What PRO adds on top of Starter Free
- How migration works
- Answers to common concerns

---

## When should you upgrade?

Upgrade when you start needing **real infrastructure**.

Use this checklist.

You likely need PRO if you need:

- Real user authentication
- Email verification & password reset
- Stripe Checkout & Customer Portal
- Multi-organization support
- Role-based access control
- Production data layer
- API contracts and backend patterns

Starter Free is the **surface**.
PRO is the **wiring**.

---

## Free vs PRO comparison

| Capability | Starter Free | PRO |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication | Screens + states (mocked) | Provider wiring (Auth.js / Clerk / Supabase) |
| Billing | Billing UI surface | Stripe Checkout + Portal integration |
| Organizations | Single-org UI | Multi-org + org switcher |
| Roles & permissions | Basic roles UI | RBAC + permission patterns |
| Data layer | Mock data | Production data + API contracts |
| Backend patterns | None | Server routes + architecture guidance |
| Packaging | Demo-ready | Production-ready foundation |

## What you gain by upgrading

### Time saved

Auth and billing wiring can take weeks.
PRO removes the uncertainty and gives a proven baseline.

---

### Reduced risk

Security and billing mistakes are expensive.
PRO provides safe integration patterns.

---

### Production readiness

Starter Free proves the product.
PRO prepares it for real users and revenue.

---

## Migration path

Upgrading is designed to be **incremental**.

You keep:
- Routes
- Pages
- Components
- UI structure

You replace:
- Mock data → real data
- Mock auth → real sessions
- Mock billing → Stripe

No rewrite required.

---

### Typical upgrade flow

1. Add auth provider
2. Add session protection
3. Add database
4. Add Stripe billing
5. Replace mock sources progressively

You migrate **feature by feature**.

---

## Common objections

### “Will I lose my changes?”

No.

Starter Free and PRO share the same architecture.
Your pages and components remain compatible.

---

### “Can I upgrade later?”

Yes.

Starter Free has no lock-in.
Upgrade whenever your product requires real wiring.

---

### “Do I need to migrate everything at once?”

No.

You can wire:
- Auth first
- Billing later
- Data progressively

Migration is incremental.

---

### “Why not wire everything myself?”

You can.

PRO exists to:
- reduce risk
- remove uncertainty
- save engineering time

It’s a leverage decision, not a requirement.

---

## Mental model to keep

> Starter Free → validate the product
> PRO → productionize the product

Both are part of the same path.

---

## Next steps

You now have the full Starter Free documentation.

Start building your product, and upgrade when you’re ready to wire the production foundation.
