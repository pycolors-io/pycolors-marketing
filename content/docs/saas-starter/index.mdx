Starter Free is a **production-shaped Next.js SaaS surface** designed to help you ship faster.

You get real screens, real navigation, real states — all mocked by design and ready to wire when your product becomes real.

This documentation guides you from **first run → understanding → wiring → upgrade path**.

---

## What this starter is

Starter Free is not:

- a blank Next.js repo
- a backend-heavy template
- a demo full of fake components

It is a **frontend-first SaaS foundation** that gives you:

- Auth UX
- Dashboard surface
- CRUD entity workflow
- Admin / members surface
- Billing surface
- Settings structure

All running locally in minutes.

---

## Who this is for

Starter Free works best if you are:

- Building a SaaS MVP
- Prototyping a product
- Pitching an idea
- Creating a frontend-first startup
- Preparing a product before wiring backend

---

## Starter Free philosophy

<Alert>
  <AlertTitle>Frontend first</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    The starter focuses on UX and structure first. You wire auth, data, and billing progressively when your product needs it.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

This approach helps you:
- validate ideas faster
- avoid premature backend complexity
- ship demos and MVPs quickly

---

## The upgrade path

Starter Free helps you **start fast**.

Later, you may need:
- production auth wiring
- Stripe integration
- role-based permissions
- multi-organization architecture

When that happens, the **PRO version** provides the production foundation.
