This page gets the starter running locally in a few minutes.

At the end, you'll be able to explore real SaaS screens: dashboard,
projects, admin, billing, settings, and auth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## You'll learn

-   How to clone and run the starter
-   What to expect on first launch
-   How to validate the installation
-   How to troubleshoot common setup issues

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Prerequisites

Make sure your environment includes:

-   **Node.js ≥ 18** (recommended: latest LTS)
-   **pnpm** installed globally
-   **Git**

Check quickly:

``` bash
node -v
pnpm -v
git --version
```

If pnpm is missing:

``` bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Step 1 — Clone the repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/pycolors-io/pycolors-starter-free.git
cd pycolors-starter-free
```

## Step 2 — Install dependencies

``` bash
pnpm install
```

This installs:

-   Next.js App Router
-   Tailwind v4
-   PyColors UI
-   TypeScript + ESLint baseline

## Step 3 — Start the development server

``` bash
pnpm dev
```

Open:

    http://localhost:3000

You should see the dashboard.

## Step 4 — Validate the starter

Open these routes:

-   /login
-   /register
-   /dashboard
-   /projects
-   /admin
-   /billing
-   /settings

If all pages load → installation is complete.

## First things to try

### Edit the dashboard title

Open:

``` bash
app/dashboard/page.tsx
```

Change the heading text and save.

Hot reload should update the browser instantly.

### Rename the core entity

Search for **Projects** in the repo.

This is intentionally easy to rename to your domain model.

### Modify mock data

Open:

``` bash
components/projects/project-types.ts
```

Change the mock projects to match your product.

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

``` bash
pnpm dev --port 3001
```

### Node version errors

``` bash
node -v
```

Upgrade to Node LTS and reinstall dependencies.

### Using npm or yarn

``` bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
pnpm install
```

### Build errors after pulling updates

``` bash
rm -rf node_modules .next
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Common pitfalls

Starter Free does not require:

-   database URL
-   auth secrets
-   Stripe keys

Everything is mocked.

## What you should see

You now have a local SaaS surface with:

-   Auth screens
-   Dashboard
-   CRUD UI
-   Admin surface
-   Billing surface
-   Settings structure

All running locally with hot reload.
