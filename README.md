## Appearance

The footer, mobile navigation menus, and desktop Products menu offer two site
palettes: **PyColors** (violet, the default) and **Monochrome** (black, white, and
neutral grays). This choice is separate from the Light, Dark, and System
appearance controls.

Preferences are saved in the browser and shared across marketing pages, the
blog, and documentation. If browser storage is unavailable, palette changes
still apply for the current visit. Theme Builder previews and exports keep
their own configured colors.
